### gson (json parser in gleam)

Tried to follow along with the following article: https://parsed.dev/articles/Writing_your_own_JSON_parser_in_Haskell as parsing is
quite unfamiliar to me.

Simple json parser for learning's sake, have a function called `parse` which takes a `String` and returns a type
representing JSON values.

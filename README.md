### gson (json parser in gleam)

Simple json parser for learning's sake, have a function called `parse` which takes a `String` and returns a type
representing JSON values. Tried to test each parse fn to get some sense of correctness.


Used the following article: https://parsed.dev/articles/Writing_your_own_JSON_parser_in_Haskell as parsing is
quite unfamiliar to me and wasn't entirely sure where to start.
